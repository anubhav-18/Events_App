To engage more college students with your event app and optimize Google Ads campaigns, here are some strategies you can consider:

Promote Social Interaction: Include features in your app that allow users to interact with each other, such as commenting on events, sharing events with friends, or even creating study groups or event-specific communities. Social engagement can keep users coming back to your app regularly.

Gamification: Introduce gamification elements such as leaderboards, badges, or points for attending events, inviting friends, or completing certain activities within the app. This can incentivize users to engage more with your app and its content.

Personalization: Implement a recommendation system that suggests events based on users' interests, past event attendance, or campus activities. Personalized recommendations can enhance user experience and encourage users to explore more events.

In-App Notifications: Send timely and relevant notifications to users about upcoming events, registration deadlines, or special promotions. Keep the notifications concise and engaging to encourage users to take action.

Interactive Content: Incorporate interactive content within event listings or detailed pages, such as polls, quizzes, or surveys related to the event topic. This can make the app experience more interactive and appealing to users.

User-Generated Content: Allow users to contribute content to the app, such as event reviews, photos, or videos. User-generated content adds authenticity and diversity to your app, making it more attractive to potential users.

Partnerships and Collaborations: Collaborate with student organizations, clubs, or campus departments to promote their events through your app. In return, they can help promote your app to their members and followers, expanding your user base.

Google Ads Campaigns: When running Google Ads campaigns, focus on targeting college campuses or specific student demographics. Use engaging ad creatives that highlight the benefits of using your app, such as discovering exciting events, connecting with peers, or enhancing campus life.

Ad Placement and Timing: Place your ads strategically on platforms where college students are likely to spend time, such as social media, campus websites, or student forums. Consider the timing of your ads to coincide with key events or periods when students are more active and receptive to new opportunities.

Offer Incentives: Provide incentives for downloading and using your app, such as exclusive access to VIP events, discounts or freebies at partner venues, or entry into contests or giveaways. Incentives can motivate users to engage with your app and spread the word to their peers.
